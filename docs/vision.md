## Summary
Many of the residents in the Philippines do not have the money to purchase luxury items such as an iPad or iPhone, and saving money is often difficult.  **PisoAuction** provides an opportunity for participants to win an item they otherwise could not afford at a significantly reduced price.  If a participant does not win the item they bid on, a portion of the money spent to purchase bids to bid on the item is saved and associated with their account.  In the future, the user ca pay the difference in price for the item and purchase it as a retail item.

**PisoAuction** is an auction in which participants must pay a non-refundable fee to place a small incremental bid.  When time expires, the last participant to have placed a bid wins the auction, and also pays the final bid price.  This final bid price is nearly always significantly lower than the MSRP of the item.  This is how a user may acquire a luxury item at a reduced price.

Unlike most other penny-auctions, **PisoAuction** provides participants with the opportunity to buy an item by paying the remaining balance of an item if they previously bid on that item, but lost.  The discount that the participant recieves is proportional to the number of bids that were placed in that item's auction.

The goal of **PisoAuction** is to provide participants with a fun and exciting new way to purchase or save for the things they want through the excitement of a safe and reliable penny auction.

## Goals
What are we trying to achieve (and how do we wish to achieve it)?
* We will create a fair, responsive, and easy-to-understand penny auction.
* We will create a fun and enjoyable experience for all participants.

## Market Context

**Target Markets**
**Competitive Differentiators**
**Compelling Events**
**Contractural Agreements**

(Need to get this information from Daniel Mendez)

## Stakeholders
The users (in the widiest sense) of the system.  Many of these will map to actors or control equipment that maps to actors.

(Stakeholder :: Actor)
* Users :: User
* Developers :: PisoAuction
* Board of Directors
* CPA
* Investors
* PaymentSystem :: PaymentSystem
* Suppliers :: Supplier

## Key Features
At the very highest level, what are the key functional aspects of the problem/desired solution? These will largely map down to the use cases.  It is helpful to specify some prioritization here.

**[ NOT PRIORITIZED YET ]**
* User Registration
* Limited social interaction via public user profiles.
* Incentives for users to bid.
* Bid Pack & Auction specials that coincide with regional holidays and events.
* A fair, balanced, and exciting bidding process to prevent users from gaining a significant advantage.
* All users receive the same auction information, including the previous 10 bids, all bidders who have been involved in the auction, previous auction ending prices, and a quick and responsive bidding mechanism.
* Automated item purchase and shipping.



## Constraints
Need to define a high level view of the non-functional parameters of the system.  We can worked these out in detail in the supplementary requirements specification.

* System Load
* User's Interest in items up for auction.
* User's income and time
* Supplier's inventory & shipping speed.
