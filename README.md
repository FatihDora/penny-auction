# PisoAuction

### Project Description
**PisoAuction** is an auction in which participants must pay a non-refundable
fee to place a small incremental bid.  When time expires, the last participant
to have placed a bid wins the item and also pays the final bid price.  This
final bid price is nearly always significantly lower than the MSRP of the item.

Unlike most other penny-auctions, **PisoAuction** provides participants with the
opportunity to buy an item at a reduced price if they previously bid on that
item, but lost.  The discount that the participant recieves is proportional
to the amount of bids the user committed to the item while in auction.

### Overall Goal
The goal of **PisoAuction** is to provide participants with a fun and exciting
new way to purchase the things they want.  If we do not currently have an item
up for bid, users can up-vote their favorite items to ensure that the items
they most desire are available for winning or purchase in a timely manner.  We
hold the user experience to be of great importance, and so are committed to
providing excellent customer support and service in hopes that every participant
will continually turn to **PisoAuction** to fulfill their shopping needs.
