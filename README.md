This is an implementation of a penny auction site like [Deal
Dash](http://www.dealdash.com) for use on Google App Engine infrastructure. The
code is a bit messy both from being a rapidly developed prototype and because
it was not intended to be open sourced.

Originally this code was commissioned by a company, Praetorium US, for use in a
penny auction site they intended to launch in the Phillipines. Unfortunately
Praetorium was unable to meet its obligations, and the developers and
Praetorium owners amicably agreed to allow the code to be open sourced. As a
result, this project is now free for anyone to use under the terms of the AGPL.
